# A short intro to functional programming principles
## Intro
This repository describes some of the fundametal principles of
functional programming. It is not an introduction to any specific
programming language, but rather a way to introduce the way of
thinking that is typical for functional programming.
## Examples
All examples will be in Haskell, though not _good_ Haskell. The idea is to show
off functional programming principles, not good or idiomatic Haskell.
You can try everything out for yourself:
```bash
docker run -it --rm haskell:9
```
