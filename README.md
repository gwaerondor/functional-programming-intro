# A short intro to functional programming principles
## Intro
This repository describes some of the fundametal principles of
functional programming. It is not an introduction to any specific
programming language, but rather a way to introduce the way of
thinking that is typical for functional programming.

To be able to follow it, it's helpful to already have some programming
experience, since most examples and explanations will compare the
functional programming way to the procedural or object oriented way.
## Examples
All examples will be in Haskell, though not _good_ Haskell. The idea is to show
off functional programming principles, not good or idiomatic Haskell.
You can try everything out for yourself:
```bash
docker run -it --rm haskell:9
```
